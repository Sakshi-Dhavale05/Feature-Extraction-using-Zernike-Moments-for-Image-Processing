# Feature-Extraction-using-Zernike-Moments-for-Image-Processing
This project implements feature extraction from images using Zernike moments, a powerful technique for obtaining shape-based features that are invariant to rotation, scaling, and translation. It focuses on calculating Zernike moments for a set of images, which can later be used for various machine learning or pattern recognition tasks.

Project Highlights:
-Computation of Zernike moments up to a desired order.
-Preprocessing of images (grayscale conversion, resizing, thresholding).
-Extraction of numerical feature vectors from images.
-Example application to a dataset.
-Clean and modular Python code.

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, mahotas (for Zernike moment computation).
